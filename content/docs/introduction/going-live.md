# Going Live 🌎🌍🌏

Once you complete the sandbox integration, the next step is to go live. Please have another read about the differences between sandbox and live in the above section, and prepare for the go-live items. Generally speaking, we would need the following from you to open the live system for you.

1. Your business entity documents, such as certificates of incorporation and tax ID
2. Screenshots/video of your application interfaces
3. KYC process document if you are fully-disclosed
4. Expectation for the funding process if you already have something in mind

And with all this information provided, we will have a business agreement between you and Alpaca.

We generally recommend to start from alpha/beta launch with a limited access, to ensure the operation works well, both on your side and Alpaca’s side. Once the process is understood, you can go ahead and launch. We are happy to help the marketing side as well.
