# Non-disclosed Broker Dealer

This non-disclosed broker dealer refers to a setup between the fully-disclosed broker dealer case and omnibus setup. Your end customers are not fully known and you are fully responsible for KYC and AML (in this sense it is an omnibus), but Alpaca provides customer accounting functionality with each trading account in an anonymous status.

The requirements around the tax are the same as the omnibus setup or a bit more complicated as we may withhold income gains at the individual level.#
