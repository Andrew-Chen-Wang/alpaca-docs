# Integration Setup

There are several different use cases for Broker API integration. When you integrate, you may want to check about how your business uses it. Below are some common use cases, but please do not hesitate to reach out to our sales contact for your own specific case.

- Fully-disclosed broker dealer
- Non-disclosed broker dealer
- Omnibus
- RIA (Registered Investment Advisor)
- Non-financial institution / technology provider

Depending on the type of the setup, the API methods you want to use could vary. For example, the Omnibus setup never uses API to open a customer account since the trading accounts are created upfront and you will submit orders to them, and manage your end customer accounting on your end. More details on each setup are described in the following section.
