# Fully Disclosed

The fully-disclosed broker dealer means your end customers are introduced to Alpaca on the individual basis, and we need to see each customer's information to provide our service.

If you are a broker dealer under some jurisdiction, you can own end-to-end user experiences from account opening to reporting. You are responsible for KYC and AML, and Alpaca relies on your process after we review it, to meet our regulatory requirements.

In this setup, you will use most of the API methods such as the Account, Transfer and Trading API. In addition, you can move the cash and securities between your firm account and end-customer accounts using the Journal API to implement features such as reward programs.
