# Market Data

```
COMING SOON
```

You can access the basic market data with Alpaca Data API. Your Broker API key
is authorized to access Data API for the basic plan equivalent data. This is
free of charge and you can redistribute it to your end user without additional
agreement. All the API endpoints are documented [here](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/market-data/).

The higher tier of market data needs additional agreement and charges to Alpaca
and corresponding exchanges. If you need this integration, please contact us.
