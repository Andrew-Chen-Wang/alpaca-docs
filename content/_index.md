# Welcome to Broker API Documentation!

&nbsp;

We have designed our Broker API around REST. All HTTP requests are JSON-encoded.

You can use this document in both sandbox and live environments.
Sandbox environment was designed to allow you to start building immediately and finish up the business side of things in parallel.
